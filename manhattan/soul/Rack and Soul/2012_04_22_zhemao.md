## The Verdict

Okay BBQ food. Good for large group meals. Certainly not as good as Soul/BBQ
food you can get in the South. 

Moses summarized this experience pretty well. I will just add some additional 
comments on things that he left out.

## Food

### Entrees

#### Pulled Pork

Pulled pork was far too dry. You should not need to add barbecue sauce in order
to make pulled pork taste good. Would not order again.

### Sides

#### Okra

Oh my god, the steamed Okra was amazing. Of all the things we ate at the meal,
this was the only one that really stood out. The Okra was mixed with corn, 
tomatoes, and a few other vegetables. It was basically just a very thick Gumbo.

## Bathrooms

They were pretty decent. There are two one-person bathrooms which are kept 
pretty clean. There are no paper towels though.
